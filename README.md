The analysis employed logistic regression to classify cars as either small or big based on their cost and weight across three groups (A, B, and C). Group A demonstrated perfect classification, with 100% accuracy, precision, and recall, suggesting a clear linear separation between car types. Group B showed excellent performance with 99% accuracy, indicating a strong but not perfect distinction between car categories. Group C exhibited moderate performance with 73% accuracy, revealing more overlap between small and big cars. Feature importance varied across groups: in Group A, cost was slightly more influential than weight; in Group B, weight marginally outweighed cost; and in Group C, cost was notably more important than weight. These results suggest that the relationship between car size, cost, and weight differs significantly among the three groups, with Group A showing the most distinct separation and Group C the least.
